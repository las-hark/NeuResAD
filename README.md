# processing and analyzing of neural response(LFP) collected from invasive Brain-computer Interface

After my grandpa caught Alzheimer's disease, I joined a project treating Alzheimer's disease by electrical stimulation through the Brain-Computer Interface to understand what's going on and how I can help him through research.
I have:
- embedded invasive interface into the brain of the mouse with Alzheimer's disease,
- recorded neural responses when applying different deep brain stimulation of the entorhinal cortex
- examined the effects of both neurological and behavioral studies
- processed and analyzed the local field potential(LFP) signals from over 2k pieces of record from 81 mice, statistically summarized into a conclusion of how and where the simulation can improve the brain activity
  
This project was awarded as the Outstanding Undergraduate Project by the Chongqing Municipality of China.

This repo includes Matlab codes to perform LFP data preprocessing/processing/PSD and frequency-correlation hot map autoclassifier in the signal processing and analyzing stage.
